# hastieWires

HastieWires is a Jekyll plugin that facilitates quick and easy prototyping by generating pages from a yaml data file.

### Overview

Jekyll (see: http://jekyllrb.com) is a blog-aware static site generator. Jekyll can be used in a number of ways to achieve a number of desired outcomes. 

One way that Jekyll is very useful is in rapid prototyping and wireframe development, allowing the user to very quickly put together an interface which can be viewed and manipulated through the browser.  

HastieWires will generate a set of website pages and directories from one single yaml data file, making it even easier to rapidly prototype websites and web applications with Jekyll.

### How to Use

### Configuration Options

```ruby
hastieWires_dataFile: sitemap
```

The file containing the structure that is to be parsed and built. This file should reside in the _data directory per http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/. There is no default - if the variable or file is not present, the generator will not run.

```ruby
hastieWires_overwriteStatic: false
```

Optionally, the generator can be told to overwrite any static source files that exist and are generated by Jekyll, or not. Defaults to false.

```ruby
hastieWires_statusMsg: true
```

If you want the hastieWires to write to the commandline, this flag will permit that. Defaults to false.
